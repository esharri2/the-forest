# THE FOREST

The Forest is a sound and art application that allows users to overlay loops of sounds from nature. Some or all of the loops can be plugged into an effects board for distortion, reverb, slowing down, and other effects.

The sound comes from wav files found at [BBC Sound Effects](http://bbcsfx.acropolis.org.uk/).
