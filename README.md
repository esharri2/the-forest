# THE FOREST

The Forest is a sound and art application that allows users to overlay loops of sounds from nature. Some or all of the loops can be plugged into an effects board for distortion, reverb, slowing down, and other effects.

The sound comes from wav files found at [BBC Sound Effects](http://bbcsfx.acropolis.org.uk/).

## Getting Started

You just need to `yarn install` and `yarn start` to run this app locally.

Sound files are located in `src/components/Instrument/Pads`.

Effects are initiated and modified in the `Pad` component.
